# Dofus Quest Graph

Every now and then, whenever new server comes up, we want to create a new main or we're coming to some content we haven't approached before, we usually rely on dofuspourlesnoobs, dofuswiki or some other pages to help us see where to go and what to do.

Sometimes though we do encounter a questline that requires another questline that requires another questline that requires something else again.

There is also another thing of one dungeon appearing in different questlines, e.g. key master's smith dungeon will come up in bonta's alignment quest. Nileza comes up two or three times in Ice dofus quest.

So I thought, how nice it would be to have it visualized and described.

Therefore, I am looking for people that would like to contribute to such a project in GraphViz.
